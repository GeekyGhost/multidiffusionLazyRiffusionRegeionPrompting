# multidiffusionLazyRiffusionRegeionPrompting
Testing script for region prompting in the Automtaic1111 Multidiffusion extension for Riffusion usage

This creates a json file for multidiffusion to load settings. It either makes them all the same prompt or it alternates between two prompt. 
It fills in all 8 boxes with settings designs for a 512x4096 Spectrogram using the Riffusion model which can be found on Civitai. 
All settings can be manually changed in the code itself. I may add UI features to do it if theres any inteterest. 
Mainly using it for testing but obviously if testing works out I can kind of add to it to make a prompt formatter for different types of genres or who knows. 

This is meant to create json files for https://github.com/pkuliyi2015/multidiffusion-upscaler-for-automatic1111
